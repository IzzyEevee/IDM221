    <main>
      <p>In my pre-junior year of college at Drexel University, I was assigned to draw a idea for five days straight.
        My idea ended up being about flower-inspired clothing.  I feel that I did a decent job with my theme this week,
        though I feel that towards the end I just used colors of the flowers instead of the flower itself. It was kind
        of hard towards then end since I was running out of ideas in terms of dresses so I ended up using the color scheme.
        Despite that, I feel satisfied with my dresses and their design. </p>
