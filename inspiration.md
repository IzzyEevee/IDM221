What I like about this website is the whole tab thing and the transition
between the tabs. However the icons on the left side of the website could have
been more descriptive in what the tab is instead of just 'panel #'.

I really like the simple design of the website and how straight forward it is in
its advertising. First, it tells you what is it, then how it works follow by showing
how much people like it through Instagram. I especially like the Instagram part
because it auto scrolls through each post and each one is clickable to the real
 post online.

In my opinion, I liked the whole 3 column system where you can see a lot of user
specific stuff such as people you fellow. My only complain here is that I feel that
the UI is too cluttered with all 3 columns together.
